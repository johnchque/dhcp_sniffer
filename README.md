dhcp_sniffer
=======
This is a small python application that allows users to detect all DHCP packets
of a network where the computer is connected.
It displays the DHCP identifier, the mac address and the IP address assigned to
each device in a lapse of time.

This application uses pydhcplib and Gi for python.
